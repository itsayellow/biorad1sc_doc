# biorad1sc_reader_doc

This repository contains documentation for Bio-Rad 1sc files.  It is based on examining *.1sc files and deducing the structure.

Many thanks to the team of the [Open Microscopy Environment](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/).
Their software package [Bio-Formats](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/)
and their implementation of ["Bio-Rad Gel 1sc file format"](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.6.0/formats/bio-rad-gel.html)
gave me the start in investigating the structure of this file.
