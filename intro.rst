The information in this document has been gleaned from many hours of detective
work and examination of 1sc files.

Concurrently with the analysis of this 1sc file format, an implementation of a 
1sc file reader was created in python.  See:
<https://github.com/itsayellow/biorad1sc_reader>`__ and
<https://pypi.org/project/biorad1sc-reader/>`__

Many thanks to the team of the `Open Microscopy
Environment <https://www.openmicroscopy.org/>`__. Their software package
`Bio-Formats <https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/>`__ and their
implementation of `"Bio-Rad Gel 1sc file
format" <https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/6.0.0/formats/bio-rad-gel.html>`__
gave me the start in investigating the structure of this file.
